# Soccer-Robots
The goal of this project is to create autonomous robots that can play soccer in real time. The size and shape of these robots are cube shaped with dimensions approximately 17x17x17 cm^3. All the robot parts are 3D printed, with the only exceptions for the wheels and tracks which were purchased from Pololu.

My name is Jeremy Cook, and I am attending UT at Austin for Physics. My email is jeremycook97@gmail.com if you would like to contact me about this project.
