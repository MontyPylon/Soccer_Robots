# Soccer-Robots
Contains software files for my soccer robot project. The goal of this project is to create an autonomous game of 3v3 soccer with robots.

My name is Jeremy Cook, and I am attending UT at Austin for Physics. My email is jeremycook97@gmail.com if you would like to contact me about this project.
