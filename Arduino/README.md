# Arduino Source Code
This repository contains all the arduino code which runs directly on the robots. They connect to a central wifi network called "MontyPylon", and communicate with the central control computer in this way. Each soccer robot runs off of one NodeMCU (ESP 12-E DEV KIT), which can be seen below.
